## The Alley

A speakeasy hidden in the heart of West Seattle. Founded in 2018, the laidback bar hosts live jazz performances -- for anyone who can find it.

I am not affiliated with The Alley in any way, but after visiting and enjoying the music, I wanted to give back. Seeing that the [public website](https://thealleyws.com/) was lacking, and that I happened to be learning [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), I made this website as practice. 

All rights reserved to whomever has them, for frankly, I'm not sure how to contact them about transferring ownership anyways.
